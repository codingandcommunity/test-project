# Introduction  
In this curriculum you are going to make a deck of cards and make a virtual card game! 
We have written some starter code for you which has a list of cards.
Some examples of the cards are "AS" which is the Ace of Spades or "JH" which is the Jack of Hearts or "6C" which is the 6 of Clubs so on and so on.
You are going to start to add to your decks uses by creating new functions. 

In the first step you are going to add your first function called "shuffle".
