#Step 2
##Good Job on step 1!
###Now you have finished the shuffle it's time to make a deal function
###The deal function should return one card from the deck
###It is important the cards should not be repeated once they have been dealt

###One way to complete this would be to take a card from the top of the deck and then remove it
