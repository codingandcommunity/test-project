## STEP 4
---

Congrats on finishing Step 3! Now let's create the War function.  When there is a tie in the current cards being
played, this function should take in each player's hand, and follow the rules of war until the tie is broken. 


---
### Tip!
Here are the rules of war:

If a tie occurs, first each player must put three cards face down, and one card face up.
The cards faced up are then compared, and the player with the higher card played receives all
of the cards. If a tie happens again with the face up card, this procedure must be repeated again,
until the tie is broken.
