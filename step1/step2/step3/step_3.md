# Step 3
Good job! Now that you have written the deal function we can deal all the cards to the players! Now its time to write a comparison function. The purpose of this function is simply to compare the two cards currently in play.

### Tip!
To help, we've provided a switch function. This function is able to take in a card, and return a number that represents the value of that card. By using this switch function on two cards in our compare function, we are able to numerically compare two cards.

For example:

> If we have the card 7 of Diamonds ("7D"), when passed into the switch function, the int 7 is returned.

> If we have the card King of Spades ("KS"), when passed into the switch function, the int 13 is returned.
