## STEP 4
---

Congrats on finishing Step 3! Now let's create the Turn function.  This function should be able to take in each player's deck,
compare the top cards, and determine a winner. If there is a tie in the current cards being played, this function should also
be able to follow the rules of war to break the tie.

### Tip!
Here are the rules of war:

If a tie occurs, first each player must put three cards face down, and one card face up.
The cards faced up are then compared, and the player with the higher card played receives all
of the cards. If a tie happens again with the face up card, this procedure must be repeated,
until the tie is broken.
